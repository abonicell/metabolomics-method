Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) untargeted metabolomics has become the gold standard for the profiling of low-molecular-weight compounds. Recently, this discipline has raised great interest in forensic sciences, especially in the field of toxicology and for post-mortem interval estimation. The current study aims at evaluating three extraction protocols and two LC-MS/MS assays run in both positive and negative modes, to identify the most suitable method to conduct post-mortem metabolomic profiling of bone tissue. A fragment of the anterior tibia of a 82 years-old male sampled from a human taphonomy facility was powdered via freeze-milling. The powdered sub-samples were extracted in five replicates per protocol. Methods tested were (I) a biphasic chloroform–methanol–water protocol, (II) a single phase methanol–water protocol, and (III) a single phase methanol–acetonitrile–water protocol. LC-MS/MS analyses were carried out via high performance liquid chromatography, either on hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) or on reversed-phase (C18) columns in both positive and negative ionisation modes, coupled with a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Results suggest that the highest consistency between replicates and quality control samples was obtained with the single phase extractions (i.e., methanol–acetonitrile–water), whilst the ideal combination of instrumental set up HILIC chromatography in positive ionisation mode and of C18 chromatography in nega- tive ionisation mode. For the purpose of forensic investigations, a combination of a single phase extraction and the two aforementioned chromatographic and mass spectrometry modes could represent an ideal set up for obtaining bone metabolomic profiles from taphonomically altered bones.

This study did not involve human living subjects but only human tissues from deceased individuals who gave their con- sent prior to death. The institutional review board is not required in these circumstances. The ethics code of FACTS was adhered and an approval for the study was obtained from the FACTS Ethics review board as well as from the Ethics committee at UCLan (ref. SCIENCE 0223). All raw data is available on-line at Metabolomics Workbench1 using identifier PR001650. See DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4mo00015c.
